## Webhooks

Webhooks are a way for systems to send real-time notifications about events that have occurred. They work by allowing a client to provide a service that can receive notifications whenever certain events happen in Fiserv systems . With webhooks, applications can be kept up-to-date on things like authorization changes, card or account updates, and fraud alerts.

To use webhooks, FirstVision can send an HTTP POST request to a designated endpoint whenever an event occurs. This sends a notification to the receiving application, which can then take any necessary action in response. Webhooks provide a quick and efficient way for different systems to communicate and stay informed about important events.
