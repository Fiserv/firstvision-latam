# Response Code and Message Handling

Response codes identify the final status of the transaction from the Gateway, Host and/or Server (HTTP). The codes and messages are unique per transaction status which includes; approvals, declines and errors. 

---

## HTTP Status Codes

The state of the transaction can be determined by the three-digit HTTP status code from the response. These status codes are grouped in to three different classes, and the first digit can be used to quickly identify the class of a status code.

- **2xx: Success** – Indicates that the request was processed successfully. The response will include the `errors` object empty. Additionally, the response will set `hasError` to false and `data` will fill with response data.This can be the issuer response or a processor error response.
- **4xx: Client Error** – Indicates that incorrect data in request. The response will include the `errors` object, containing the `code` and `description` of the error. Additionally, the response will set `hasError` to true and `data` to null.
- **5xx: Server Error** – Indicates that the server was unable to process the request. The response will include the `errors` object, containing the `code` and `description` of the error. Additionally, the response will set `hasError` to true and `data` to null.
