# Webhook

Webhooks are a way for systems to send real-time notifications about events that have occurred. They work by allowing a client to provide a service that can receive notifications whenever certain events happen in Fiserv systems . With webhooks, applications can be kept up-to-date on things like authorization changes, card or account updates, and fraud alerts.

To use webhooks, FirstVision can send an HTTP POST request to a designated endpoint whenever an event occurs. This sends a notification to the receiving application, which can then take any necessary action in response. Webhooks provide a quick and efficient way for different systems to communicate and stay informed about important events.

For Webhook implementation, Fiserv provides the standards and API design for the different Endpoints that Clients need to implement on their side. Those endpoints are in charge of the notifications to the End User and any other functionality that Clients want to have internally.

## Sensitive information

All the payloads can contain the field encryptedData but it will be used depending on the Client needs, if the client needs Sensitive Data in Plain Text, Webhook payloads will sent this field with all the Sensitive Data in an encrypted format and then Clients will be able de decrypt it and get text plain data.
