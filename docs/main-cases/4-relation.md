### Inquiry Security Values (cards/pin/security-codes)

This API **CARDS/PIN/SECURITY-CODES**, allow to the user get the card security values (CVV, CVV2,ICVV, PIN number) already emboss for an specific card number.

Security values provided by the API will be encrypted using a security key of 32 bytes, so user should use the same security key and 3Des algorithm to decrypt the security values.

**PUT** `/cards/pin/security-codes`

Request body:  

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "0004444440000000558",
  "channel": "W",
  "keyAssociation": "AV",
  "organizationNumber": 970
}
```

### Inquire Dynamic CVV2/CVC2/4CSC (cards/pin/dynamic-value)

Use this API **CARDS/PIN/DYNAMIC-VALUE** to calculate and inquire a new CVV2 for not present card purchases.

Currently when card is emboss through the API CARD/EMBOSSER, the static CVV2 code is calculate and printed on sign panel on card back. The new functionality of Dynamic CVV2 allow to the cardholder call this API CARDS/PIN/DYNAMIC-VALUE to generate and calculate a new CVV2 before make a not present purchase. So when API is trigger the static CVV2 is inactivated and each time the cardholder wants to make a new not card present purchase the new CVV2 have to be calculated through this API.

**POST** `/cards/pin/dynamic-values`

Request body:  

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "0004444440000000558",
  "channel": "I",
  "disableDCVV2": "N",
  "keyAssociation": "OV1",
  "organizationNumber": 970
}
```

### Inquire Number of Invalid PIN Attempts (cards/pin/invalid-attempts)

This API CARDS/PIN/INVALID-ATTEMPTS allow to the cardholder get the number of invalid PIN attempts.

As part of security parameters, the number of invalid PIN attempts are set up to avoid that PIN number can be calculated for frauds proposals. When this parameter is reached the PIN number is block and a new PIN number have to be calculated.

Invalid PIN attempts can be reached by many reasons the most popular reason is when cardholder fails the PIN number on ATM.

**POST** `/cards/pin/invalid-attempts`

Request body:  

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "0004444440000000558",
  "cardSequenceNumber": 1,
  "organizationNumber": 970
}
```

The description of each API field can be found within the specifications in the portal.

### PIN Validation (cards/pin/validation)

Use this API **CARDS/PIN/VALIDATION** to confirm that current PIN generated is correct.

This API require the PIN block and the card number and not the clear PIN number.

**POST** `/cards/pin/validation`

Request body:  

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "0004444440000000558",
  "channel": "W",
  "currentPinBlock": "E06C64DAFB5CDDB2",
  "keyAssociation": "MOX",
  "organizationNumber": 970
} 
```
