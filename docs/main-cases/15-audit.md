# Audit and Monitoring

After you implement Vision+ APIs our operations team is responsible for ensuring that the APIs are available and performing as expected to maintain a seamless experience for your consumers.

Proactive detection of API traffic and performance issues is a key component to the team's success. As API traffic increases, without access to in-depth data analysis and contextual alerting, the ability to meet customer service-level agreements (SLAs) may be put at risk.

Our Monitoring helps operations teams increase API availability for application developers, customers, and partners. We could provide real-time contextual insights into API performance, helps quickly diagnose issues, and facilitates remedial actions for business continuity.
